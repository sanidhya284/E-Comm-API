📦 E-Comm API
A simple RESTful API for an e-commerce backend built using Node.js.
It currently handles:

🧑‍💼 Users

🛒 Cart

📦 Products

This is still a work in progress:

✅ REST architecture implemented

❌ No database yet (data is in-memory)

🔧 Planned improvements ahead

The source code is on GitHub, and the documentation/write-up is on Hashnode.
